# File Format

The primary goal of the file format is to avoid multiple file reads to keep appending quick.

  +--------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------+
  | length | hash length |Previous Hash|   Content   |back ref|
  +--------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--------+
  ^                                                       |
  |                                                       |
  +-------------------------------------------------------+

  * `length` - YYY bytes, unsigned integer, contains the full entry size (YYY * 2 + XXX + content.length)
  * `hash length` - YYY bytes, unsigned integer, denotes length of hash field
  * `Previous Hash` - bytes of hash data, computed over the previous entry.
  * `Content` - arbitrary length content
  * `Back ref` - same value as length

Convenient properties of this format:

  * `length` - allows for easy hashing while seeking forward
    * read the value, move back by YYY bytes, hash `length` forward
  * `back ref` - reading the last YYY bytes of the file gives you the location of the last entry
    * This allows for easy hashing of the last entry for appending.

Edge cases:

  * The first entry is special:
    * `previous hash` is going to be all 0
    * it contains randomly generated content
