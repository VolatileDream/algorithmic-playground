# File Format

The file format is dead simple, and doesn't support any fancy operations quickly.

The file is a JSON array, without the final closing bracket (']').

All operations must perform a full file read ( :c ) to know the state of the log.

The primary goal of this format is simplicity: to easily create a vector-clock log.

```
{
    # Value of the clock
    "clock": {
        "participant-1": 1
        "participant-2": 2
        ...
        "participant-N": 42
    },
    # Last incremented value
    "writer": "participant-4",
    # Content logged
    "entry": "log content goes here",
}
```

## Edge Cases

The first entry has an empty `clock`, `writer` value of `null`, and empty `entry` value.
